====================================

Application built with the following (main) technologies:

- Scala 2.11.2

Introduction
------------

Satisfy the given requirements:

Step 1: Shopping cart
* You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.
* Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
* Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost
* For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05

* Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates take a list of strings as input

Step 2: Simple offers
* The shop decides to introduce two new offers
* buy one, get one free on Apples
* 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
* Update your checkout functions accordingly
